## It's about metal

Hajime Sorayama's “Light, Reflection, Transparency” exhibition opened in Shanghai earlier this year. Due to my busy schedule, I couldn't find the time to visit until the very end of the exhibition, when I finally rushed over to see it.

Hajime Sorayama is famous for his hyperrealistic, airbrushed illustrations of erotic female robots. When photographing such all-metal subjects, black-and-white film is the natural choice to fully highlight the translucent purity of stainless steel robots. It better renders the light and dark gradations, reflections, and textures of metal, emphasizing the interplay of light and shadow to accentuate the metallic quality. This avoids the color distortion that color film might introduce, resulting in a more artistic visual effect.

### ILFORD DELTA 3200

I've always been curious about black-and-white films like **ILFORD DELTA 3200 PROFESSIONAL** and **KODAK PROFESSIONAL T-MAX P3200**, yet I've often hesitated to try them or struggled to find practical applications for them in my work. My preconceptions held that such films typically boast extremely high ISO sensitivity paired with brutally coarse grain, extreme contrast, and poor tonal gradation—qualities that starkly contrast with my personal aesthetic preferences for photographic imagery. These characteristics seemed to target documentary photographers working in harsh lighting conditions.

The turning point came during this exhibition visit. Obviously, I'm no renowned photographer, so the venue wouldn't permit tripod use indoors. This forced me to seek a film that delivered high ISO performance while maintaining acceptable image quality—which led me to ILFORD DELTA 3200.

### It should be crowned as the "DELTA 800" (or DELTA 1000, to be more precise)

Before beginning my planned shoot, I consulted the DELTA 3200 datasheet. Ilford's official documentation clearly states: **“DELTA 3200 Professional has an ISO speed rating of 1000/31° (1000ASA, 31 DIN) to daylight.”** This indicates that DELTA 3200 is actually a film with a native ISO of 1000. Its nominal box speed is achieved by pushing it using the fine-grain characteristics of DD-X developer (in this regard, Kodak P3200 is cut from the same cloth). This instantly explains the various sample images circulating online—those with grain flying everywhere, poor gray-scale transitions, and grayish shadows.

So on my way to the exhibition, I picked up a few rolls of DELTA 3200 and shot at ISO 800 (slightly pulled 1/3 stop to enhance gray-scale transitions). When I got home, developed the film, and pulled the negative out of the spool from the developing tank, I knew: it worked!

### Gears

For the camera, I chose my most familiar and beloved Pentax 67II. The 67II's larger format can potentially offset the increased graininess that might arise from using DELTA 3200, while also delivering superior overall image quality. Matrix metering allows me to conserve mental energy, enabling me to focus entirely on perceiving the spatial structure of the subject, composing the shot, and achieving precise focus.

For lenses, I selected two prime lenses: a 45mm and a 100mm. The 45mm ultra-wide angle was used to fully capture the confined spaces within the small interiors. The 100mm macro standard lens, while delivering exceptional image quality, also offered quiet operation and a closer minimum focusing distance, making it ideal for capturing close-up shots.

I deliberately avoided my most frequently used 55-100mm F4.5 zoom lens and the widely beloved, legendary 105mm F2.4 ultra-large aperture standard lens. For projects like this, my focus is on achieving a large depth of field, extreme detail and sharpness, along with beautiful, clean, and transparent gray-scale transitions—not shallow depth of field or large, dreamy bokeh.

### Some recommendations

Please allow me to briefly recommend a lens and an accessory here (if you're also a Pentax 67 system user): the SMC Pentax 67 100mm F4 Macro lens and the Pentax 67 camera left-hand grip.

- **SMC Pentax 67 100mm F4 Macro Lens**  
  This lens is incredibly sharp (trust me). If you're using a prime lens not for the shallow depth of field and dreamy bokeh that large apertures offer, but for ultimate resolving power, this lens is perfect for you—especially since it also gives you macro capability.

- **Pentax 67 Camera Left Hand Grip**  
  Contrary to many people's preconceptions, this left hand grip provides excellent support during vertical composition shooting, preventing blur caused by hand muscle tension.
