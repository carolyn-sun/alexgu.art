## Note:
In this section, I will showcase some photos I've taken with the GFX100S in my daily life, presented in SDR format.  

## Why GFX? (About My GFX100S):
It's been quite some time since I purchased the GFX100S. Back then, I wasn't satisfied with the resolution of the 5D Mark IV, so I bought the GFX. (The 5D Mark IV's 30MP sensor with a strong low-pass filter was truly lacking in detail rendering). Since I only used the GFX for still life photography back then, I didn't purchase Fujifilm's native G-mount lens lineup. Instead, I opted to adapt my full-frame EF-mount lenses for “overclocked” use.  

Over time, I gradually realized that while the GFX offered higher theoretical image quality and greater post-processing flexibility compared to the film systems I'd used before (like the Pentax 67ii), achieving comparable results demanded excessive attention and effort during both shooting and post-production. This ultimately hindered my creative workflow. For instance: When shooting scenes with highlights, the GFX (or any digital camera) requires extremely aggressive “highlight preservation” during exposure. This often forces me to compose in a pitch-black EVF at -2 to -3EV, nervously watching the far right of the histogram—an incredibly uncomfortable experience. Compounding this, the EVF on mirrorless cameras is inherently rougher than the OVF on traditional cameras, making the experience even worse. Considering all these factors, I ultimately returned to the Pentax 67ii as my primary creative tool because it allows me to focus more intently.  

The turning point came about six months ago when I began using a 4x5 large format technical camera for my serious creative work. Technical cameras require tripods, so I needed a complementary “handheld camera.” Given the bulk and weight of the large format system, carrying another Pentax 67 setup was impractical. I urgently needed a compact, more user-friendly “Pentax 67ii” – which is where the GFX100S comes in.  

Within the Pentax 67 system, my favorite and most frequently used lens was the 55-100mm F4.5 (yes, not the renowned 105mm F2.4). It delivered excellent image quality, a highly versatile focal range, an acceptable aperture, and even offered a remarkably close minimum focusing distance. Consequently, I selected the GF-mount equivalent: The GF32-64mm F4. This lens has now become my most frequently used GF-mount lens, and the GFX100S has become my daily carry camera.  



## Summer clouds and the afterglow of the setting sun:
I've always believed that the ultimate test of a camera system's color science lies in capturing “sunset glow.” When layered clouds dance across the summer sky, they add a romantic, three-dimensional quality to such scenes.  

This is precisely where the GFX100S excels: its delicate, nuanced color transitions fully showcase the advantages of 16-bit color depth. The modest dynamic range means minimal highlight protection is needed during shooting, and post-processing requires no drastic tonal or color adjustments to adapt for SDR output.  

To be fair, the GFX100S's auto white balance (or its built-in color science) exhibits a slight blue-purple bias (while the X2D, sharing the same color sensor, leans toward yellow-green). This isn't a major issue, as it can be easily corrected in Capture One during post-processing. However, this color bias makes it particularly excellent for capturing romantic, straight-out-of-camera color performance in scenes like sunset glow (just like its predecessors: the Fujifilm RVP50 and RDP3).

## Sigma space, Phase II of the Columbia Circle：
A place steeped in Japanese wabi-sabi aesthetics. My friend Color purchased a Sigma BF here. It's also a beautifully crafted camera that perfectly embodies wabi-sabi aesthetics.

## Fujifilm X-SPACE:
There are numerous photography books available for free reading here, and the reading environment is quite pleasant.

## Nearby block in the early morning:
This photo was taken to test the bokeh performance of the GF32-64mm F4 lens. While the out-of-focus areas appear somewhat busy, they still maintain the standard expected of a modern lens—a noticeable improvement over the Pentax 67's 55-100mm F4.5.

## Morning Glow:
The GFX100S truly shines in its comfort zone, where its 16-bit color depth delivers exceptional tonal gradation. This shot was captured on my way home after an all-night work session. Without the GFX's outstanding portability (compared to the Pentax 67ii system), I simply wouldn't have been able to take this photo.

## The buildings next to the subway station:

## Jianchuan Road Subway Station:
When shooting high-contrast scenes, aggressive “highlight preservation” is required to protect the transition in bright areas. This often forces you to compose and focus while staring into a pitch-black electronic viewfinder.

## Scenes with extensive highlight transitions:
When capturing such scenes, digital cameras require significantly more effort than color negative film—both during initial shooting and subsequent editing.
