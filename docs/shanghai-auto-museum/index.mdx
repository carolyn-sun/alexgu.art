## Vehicles Film photographers often favor vehicles because cars, bikes and

trucks offer rich surfaces—paint, chrome, glass and patina—that catch light and
reflections in complex, film-friendly ways, while their details and wear tell
instant stories and evoke nostalgia; they’re easy-to-find, compositionally
versatile subjects (from tight badges to wide environmental shots), often
stationary or predictably moving so the deliberate, slower film workflow works
well, and film’s grain, color rendition and highlight roll-off tend to flatter
textures, add mood, and enhance the cinematic or documentary feel of automotive
scenes.

## 5203

Kodak 5203 is truly unforgettable in its fine grain—so much so that when digitally scanned and viewed at 100% magnification on the GFX100s, no grain is detectable, making focusing difficult. It's genuinely absurd.

Personally, I find it smoother than Ektar, though its color rendering and dynamic range seem closer to Portra (though this is debatable). Used well, it could easily replace Ektar.

Incidentally, I discovered that expired 120 motion picture film rolls cause severe carbon residue issues—a thick layer that stubbornly clings to the film, impossible to remove in the darkroom, severely compromising image quality.

Unlike 135 motion picture film, 120 motion picture film requires trimming the top and bottom edges of the 65mm spool. The absence of edge markings makes it impossible for consumers to identify the spool's production batch. Should issues arise later, there's often no proof to back up claims. Therefore, when purchasing 120 film, it's crucial to find a reliable and trustworthy vendor.
